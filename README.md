February 5th,
Found a list of phobias to pull from. Also found pictures corresponding to the phobias for using with the quiz. Started CSS of page. Wallpaper set and fonts found. question box formed and centered.
Problems: placing stylesheets under my css stylesheet made me lose CSS functions
For tomorrow: move play button to center, get pictures to fit in the quiz box, need to figure out where player names and scores go

February 6th,
Got the questions and answers to show up in Quiz box.
Problems: game fails on last question and result box still needs to show up.  Need to adjust display features and get pictures to show up in the quiz box

Changed up some CSS to make the page more pleasing to the eye. Got pictures to show up in the quiz box and got the buzz in feature for each player to work. answers don't show up until someone answers. created instructions modal but need to change the appearance and function

February 8th
Changed more CSS, cleaned up the answers and question fields. Got the page to display who's turn it is when they buzz in.
